# We are "Team Einstein"
## A team of 20 members for HackBio'2020 Virtual Bioinformatics Internship

### Team Work
**This is the main repository for the HackBio'2020 Virtual Internship Program. Main goal of the project is to write the small scripts in different languages which prints the Name, E-mail, slack_username and biostack. After completing the scripting we have to make csv file with rows corresponding to the person and columns to the values (as name, e-mail, slack_username and biostack) in bash, using outputs from scripts.**
